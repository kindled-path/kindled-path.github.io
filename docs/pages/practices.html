                <p>The teachings of this path are not meant for intellectual entertainment alone. They call for transformation&mdash;for living differently, dying differently, becoming what we already are. These practices have been used by seekers for centuries.</p>

        <!-- THE DAILY PRACTICE -->
        <section class="practice-section">
            <div class="practice-content">
                <h2>The Daily Practice</h2>
                <p>Consistency matters more than intensity. A few minutes of practice each day will transform you more than occasional hours of fervor.</p>

                <h3>The Morning Awakening</h3>
                <p>Before rising, before the mind fills with the day's concerns, take a moment to remember:</p>

                <div class="practice-steps">
                    <h4>The Practice</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Lie still. Do not move immediately upon waking.</li>
                        <li>Become aware of your breath. Do not control it; simply notice it.</li>
                        <li>Remember: "I am not separate from the Divine. Today is given for transformation."</li>
                        <li>Bring to mind one of the twenty-nine teachings. Let it be your companion for the day.</li>
                        <li>Rise slowly, carrying the stillness with you into activity.</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>

                <h3>The Practice of Presence</h3>
                <p>Brother Lawrence taught that God is present always and everywhere. The practice is simply to notice.</p>

                <div class="practice-quote">
                    <p>"While I wash the dishes, I do not cease to pray. While I cook the meals, I am in communion. The prayer is not words but attention&mdash;the simple, continuous awareness that God is here, now, in this very moment."</p>
                </div>

                <p>Throughout the day, pause. Wherever you are, whatever you are doing, take three breaths and remember: this moment, this place, this activity is sacred. There is no separation between mundane and holy.</p>

                <h3>The Evening Review</h3>
                <p>Before sleep, review the day:</p>

                <div class="practice-steps">
                    <h4>The Practice</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Sit in stillness. Let the body settle.</li>
                        <li>Review the day from morning to evening, without judgment.</li>
                        <li>Notice moments when you forgot the teaching. Do not condemn yourself; simply notice.</li>
                        <li>Notice moments when you remembered. Give thanks.</li>
                        <li>Release the day. Let it dissolve like the thirty birds entering the Simurgh.</li>
                        <li>Sleep as practice for death&mdash;the temporary dissolution of the ego.</li>
                    </ol>

        <!-- LECTIO DIVINA -->
        <section class="practice-section">
            <div class="practice-content">
                <h2>Sacred Reading (Lectio Divina)</h2>
                <p>The ancient practice of reading scripture not for information but for transformation.</p>

                <h3>The Four Movements</h3>

                <div class="practice-steps">
                    <h4>Lectio (Reading)</h4>
                    <p>Read a passage from the scripture slowly, aloud if possible. Let the words enter through the ear as well as the eye. Do not hurry. When a word or phrase catches your attention, stop. This is where the Divine is speaking to you today.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="practice-steps">
                    <h4>Meditatio (Meditation)</h4>
                    <p>Stay with the word or phrase that caught you. Turn it over in your mind like a precious stone. Ask: What is this saying to me? Why did it arrest my attention? Let meanings arise without forcing them.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="practice-steps">
                    <h4>Oratio (Prayer)</h4>
                    <p>Respond to what you have received. This may be words, or it may be wordless. The response might be gratitude, or longing, or confession, or simply presence. Let your heart speak.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="practice-steps">
                    <h4>Contemplatio (Contemplation)</h4>
                    <p>Rest in silence. Release the word, the meditation, the prayer. Enter the Cloud of Unknowing where thought ceases and presence remains. Stay as long as you can. When thoughts return, do not fight them; simply return to silence.</p>
                </div>

                <p>Practice this daily with different passages from the scripture. Over time, the teachings will work their way into your being.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <!-- THE DARK NIGHT -->
        <section class="practice-section">
            <div class="practice-content">
                <h2>Embracing the Dark Night</h2>

                <div class="practice-warning">
                    <p><strong>Note:</strong> This section addresses those who are already experiencing spiritual darkness. If you are in psychological crisis, seek appropriate professional support. The Dark Night is a spiritual condition, not a substitute for mental health care.</p>
                </div>

                <p>Sometimes the practices stop working. The presence once felt is absent. The words once meaningful become empty. The soul hangs suspended in void with nothing to grasp.</p>

                <p>This is the Dark Night of the Soul. It is not punishment but preparation.</p>

                <h3>What to Do</h3>

                <div class="practice-quote">
                    <p>"Do not pray to avoid the Dark Night. Pray only for the courage to endure it. For on the other side lies the dawn."<br>&mdash; Juan de la Cruz</p>
                </div>

                <div class="practice-steps">
                    <h4>During the Darkness</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Continue the practices</strong>, even when they seem pointless. The body remembers what the mind forgets. Maintain the form; the spirit will return.</li>
                        <li><strong>Do not cling to previous experiences.</strong> What you felt before is not what you need now. Let go of expectations.</li>
                        <li><strong>Trust the process.</strong> The darkness strips away every crutch so that you can rely on the Essential alone.</li>
                        <li><strong>Reach out to others.</strong> Community sustains us when solitary practice fails. You are not alone, even when you feel alone.</li>
                        <li><strong>Remember the teaching:</strong> "The darkest hour precedes the brightest dawn. Do not flee the darkness."</li>
                    </ol>

                <p>Throughout the year, we remember those who walked the path before us.</p>

                <h3>The Martyrs' Calendar</h3>

                <div class="daily-schedule">
                    <span class="schedule-time">June 19</span>
                    <span class="schedule-activity"><strong>Jacopo's Day</strong> &mdash; Commemoration of the Friend. A day for reflecting on loyalty, friendship, and the courage to remain silent when speech would betray.</span>

                    <span class="schedule-activity"><strong>Robert's Day</strong> &mdash; Commemoration of the Poet. A day for reflecting on the power of words, the courage to speak truth, and the willingness to act on convictions.</span>

                    <span class="schedule-activity"><strong>Arad Day</strong> &mdash; Commemoration of the Thirteen, including Vilmos and Lajos. A day for reflecting on collective sacrifice and the bonds that unite those who die for the same cause.</span>

                    <span class="schedule-activity"><strong>Ludwig's Day</strong> &mdash; Commemoration of the Last Martyr. A day for remembering the forgotten, those whose deaths went unnoticed but whose sacrifice was no less meaningful.</span>
                </div>

                <h3>How to Observe</h3>
                <p>On these days:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Read the relevant gospel from Part II of the scripture</li>
                    <li>Light a candle at dawn and let it burn throughout the day</li>
                    <li>Fast from one meal as a symbolic sharing in their sacrifice</li>
                    <li>Perform an act of service in their memory</li>
                    <li>In the evening, share a meal with others walking the path</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </section>

        <!-- COMMUNITY -->
        <section class="practice-section">
            <div class="practice-content">
                <h2>Walking Together</h2>
                <p>The path is walked alone, but not in isolation. Jouffroy taught that no individual possesses absolute truth; we need each other.</p>

                <h3>Forming a Circle</h3>
                <p>Gather with others who walk the path. Meet weekly if possible, monthly at minimum.</p>

                <div class="practice-steps">
                    <h4>The Gathering Practice</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Opening</strong> &mdash; Light a candle. Read one of the twenty-nine teachings aloud.</li>
                        <li><strong>Silence</strong> &mdash; Sit together in silence for at least ten minutes. The shared silence is its own teaching.</li>
                        <li><strong>Reading</strong> &mdash; Read a passage from the scripture. Each person speaks what they noticed. Do not debate; simply share.</li>
                        <li><strong>Witness</strong> &mdash; Each person briefly shares: "This week, I experienced..." Keep it short. Listen without advising.</li>
                        <li><strong>Closing</strong> &mdash; Extinguish the candle. Speak the words: "The Pattern continues. The work goes on."</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>

                <h3>The Rule of the Circle</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Confidentiality</strong> &mdash; What is shared in the circle stays in the circle.</li>
                    <li><strong>Non-judgment</strong> &mdash; We do not evaluate each other's experiences or progress.</li>
                    <li><strong>Presence</strong> &mdash; We show up, even when we don't feel like it.</li>
                    <li><strong>Service</strong> &mdash; The circle serves the world, not only itself.</li>
