# Bible-2: The Path of Illumination

## Project Vision

This project creates a comprehensive, spiritually enriching website experience centered around **The Book of Illumination and Sacrifice** — a sacred text that synthesizes nearly forgotten wisdom traditions spanning seven centuries.

The core text weaves together:
- **Sufi mystical poetry** from Persia (Attar, Rumi, Jami, Sanai)
- **Alchemical and Hermetic writings** (Paracelsus, the Emerald Tablet)
- **Christian mysticism** (The Cloud of Unknowing, Dark Night of the Soul, Teresa of Ávila)
- **Jakob Böhme's visionary works** (Aurora, Signature of All Things)
- **Spiritualist philosophy** (Andrew Jackson Davis)
- **Historical martyrdom accounts** (1833-1850 revolutionary period)

All source texts are in the public domain.

## Core Purpose

The website invites visitors to:
1. **Discover** the scripture through beautiful, accessible presentation
2. **Study** deeply with guides, commentary, and reflection questions
3. **Apply** the teachings to real life choices and transformations
4. **Connect** with a community of fellow seekers

## The Central Teaching

The Pattern that runs through all gathered texts:
- Transformation requires death — the dissolution of what we believe ourselves to be
- The seeker and the sought are one
- Suffering is the path, not the obstacle
- What the ancient mystics taught in poetry, the modern martyrs demonstrated in history
